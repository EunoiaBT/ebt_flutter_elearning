## Layers in Clean Architecture

- **Data Layer**: Responsible for fetching data from APIs, databases, or other data sources. It includes models, data sources, and repositories.
- **Domain Layer**: The business logic of the application, including entities and use cases. It’s independent of any other layer.
- **Presentation Layer**: Manages the UI and user interaction, utilizing state management (e.g., BLoC) to communicate with the domain layer.
